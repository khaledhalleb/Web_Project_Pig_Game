About the Game : 

Two players are going to play in rounds: so a player rolls a dice as many times as he want and for each roll the result  is going 
 to be added to that round's score. But When the player rolls gets a  1, all of that round's score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
 The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that the round score will be added to his Total. After that, it's the next player's turn
===> The first player to reach 50 points on Total score wins!!!!!
